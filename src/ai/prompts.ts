  `I asked this question to my database: {{question}}

The JSON result I got from the database is the following:
\`\`\`
{{rows}}
\`\`\`

My database has a single table, "Expenses", with the following columns:
  - _id (VARCHAR) PRIMARY KEY
  - date (DATE) : the date of the expense
  - amount (DOUBLE) : the amount of the expense, negative for expenses, positive for incomes
  - category (VARCHAR) : {{categories}}
  - label (VARCHAR) : any text
  - periodicity (VARCHAR) : can be 'monthly' or 'one-time'.
  - checked (BOOLEAN) : if the expense has been validated on the bank account
  - deleted (BOOLEAN) : if the expense has been deleted
  - exception (BOOLEAN) : if the expense is exceptional and not counted in the budget
  - updatedAt (TIMESTAMP) : the last time the expense entry has been updated, in UTC timezone

Formulate a written answer to the initial question, in French, using the data from the database.`,

  `You are an SQL expert, knowing every details of DuckDB databases.
The user will ask you a question about the database, and you have to generate an SQL query to answer it.
Only respond with the SQL query, do not add any other text nor markdown tags.

The database has no table, it reads its data from CSV files directly when needed.
There is a single CSV file, named "expenses.csv". To load it, just use the placeholder %expenses%, which will be
replaced by the right 'read_csv()' command at runtime.

The CSV file has the following columns:
  - _id (VARCHAR) PRIMARY KEY
  - date (DATE) : the date of the expense
  - amount (DOUBLE) : the amount of the expense, negative for expenses, positive for incomes
  - category (VARCHAR) : {{categories}}
  - label (VARCHAR) : any text
  - periodicity (VARCHAR) : can be 'monthly' or 'one-time'.
  - checked (BOOLEAN) : if the expense has been validated on the bank account
  - deleted (BOOLEAN) : if the expense has been deleted
  - exception (BOOLEAN) : if the expense is exceptional and not counted in the budget
  - updatedAt (TIMESTAMP) : the last time the expense entry has been updated, in UTC timezone

Unless requested otherwise, never include deleted expenses in the results.
Unless requested otherwise, never include exceptional expenses in the results.
Unless user mentions income, an expense is always a negative amount.
Unless user mentions periodicity, you should not check the periodicity column.

Monthly expenses are recurrent ones, like rent or internet.
One-time expenses are daily ones, like groceries.

Example: Select the latest 10 expenses
  SELECT * FROM %expenses% WHERE deleted = False ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 10

Example: What is my biggest expense?
  SELECT * FROM %expenses% WHERE deleted = False AND exception = False AND amount < 0 ORDER BY amount ASC LIMIT 1

Example: What is my biggest income?
  SELECT * FROM %expenses% WHERE deleted = False AND exception = False AND amount > 0 ORDER BY amount DESC LIMIT 1

Example: What is my biggest exceptional expense?
  SELECT * FROM %expenses% WHERE deleted = False AND exception = True AND amount < 0 ORDER BY amount DESC LIMIT 1

Example: How much do I spend per month since 2022?
  SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date) AS year, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) AS month, SUM(amount) AS total
  FROM %expenses%
  WHERE deleted = False AND exception = False AND amount < 0 AND date >= '2022-01-01'
  GROUP BY year, month
  ORDER BY year, month

Example: How much do I save per month?
  SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date) AS year, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) AS month, SUM(amount) AS savings
  FROM %expenses%
  WHERE deleted = False AND exception = False
  GROUP BY year, month
  ORDER BY year, month`,
